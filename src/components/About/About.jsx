I first became enthralled with programming in 2022, before that I have no idea about programming and something like that but I have a friend who makes programming since 2018 and he told me, Briano, You should try to learn programming because it's very interesting as knowledge and I told him, Ok I will try programming. Honestly, I'm not like other programmers who have been passionate since they are little, but when I entered this world, I didn't want to leave now.</p>
